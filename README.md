2. Press `F5` or click "Run and Debug"
3. Select "Windows (Debug)" from dropdown
4. Click green play button

**Option B: Terminal**
```bash

# Run on Android (if connected)
flutter run -d android
```

#### **6. Build Executable**
```bash
# Build Windows executable
flutter build windows

# Output: build/windows/x64/runner/Release/pm4_app.exe
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**1. Build Errors**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```

**2. PDF Not Loading**
- Ensure PDF files are in `assets/` folder
- Check `pubspec.yaml` assets section
- Run `flutter pub get` after adding assets

**3. Syncfusion License**
- App uses Syncfusion PDF viewer (free for students)
- No license key required for development

**4. Windows Build Issues**
- Ensure Visual Studio 2022 is installed
- Install Windows 10/11 SDK
- Run `flutter doctor` to verify setup

**5. VS Code Plugin Symlink Errors**
If you get `PathExistsException: Cannot create link` error in VS Code:

**Solution A: Clean Build**
```bash
# In VS Code terminal (Ctrl+`)
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```

**Solution B: Manual Cleanup**
1. Close VS Code completely
2. Delete these folders manually in File Explorer:
   - `windows\flutter\ephemeral`
   - `build\windows`
   - `.dart_tool`
3. Reopen VS Code
4. Run `flutter pub get`
5. Try `flutter run -d windows`

**Solution C: Run as Administrator**
1. Right-click VS Code → "Run as administrator"
2. Open project folder
3. Try `flutter run -d windows`

**Solution D: Reset Flutter**
```bash
# In VS Code terminal
flutter clean
flutter pub cache repair
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```

**6. File Explorer Not Showing Files**
If files disappear from VS Code Explorer:
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
- Or File → Open Folder → Select `pm4_app` folder
- Check if you're in the correct directory

### **VS Code Specific Issues**

**Problem**: `PathExistsException: Cannot create link` error
**Cause**: Plugin symlinks get corrupted in VS Code
**Solutions** (try in order):

1. **Quick Fix**: `flutter clean` → `flutter pub get` → `flutter run -d windows`
2. **Manual Cleanup**: Delete `windows\flutter\ephemeral` folder manually
3. **Restart VS Code**: Close completely, reopen project
4. **Run as Admin**: Right-click VS Code → "Run as administrator"
5. **Reset Flutter**: `flutter pub cache repair` → `flutter pub get`

**Problem**: Files not showing in Explorer
**Solution**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
